LeNet, conceived by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998, represents an seminal convolutional neural network (CNN) with significance that includes:

- **Pioneering Architecture:** It was the first to integrate convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, establishing the blueprint for modern CNNs and accelerating the adoption of deep learning in computer vision.
  
- **Practical Application:** Its successful deployment in handwritten digit recognition, notably in check processing systems, demonstrated the practical efficacy of CNNs in real-world scenarios.
  
- **Foundational Techniques:** LeNet introduced key concepts such as local connections, weight sharing, and downsampling, which not only minimized the number of parameters but also set the design principles for subsequent influential models like AlexNet and ResNet.
