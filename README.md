# ResNet18

ResNet18 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is 18 layers deep. It was introduced by He et al. in their paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" and won the ILSVRC 2015 competition with an error rate of 3.57%.

## Key Features:
- **Depth**: Consists of 18 layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Skip Connections**: Introduces skip connections or shortcuts to jump over some layers. This helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and allows training deeper networks.
- **Bottleneck Design**: Uses bottleneck designs which reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity while maintaining performance.

## Architecture:
The architecture consists of several residual blocks, each containing three convolutional layers. The first layer has a stride of 2 to downsample the input, and the remaining layers have a stride of 1.

## Applications:
ResNet18 has been widely used in various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation due to its robustness and effectiveness.

## Advantages:
- Easier optimization compared to shallower networks.
- Strong performance on image recognition tasks.
- Can be easily modified for different tasks by changing the final layers.

## Disadvantages:
- High memory consumption due to the large number of parameters.
- Slower training time compared to shallower networks without residual connections.

Overall, ResNet18 is a powerful and versatile CNN architecture that has significantly advanced the state of the art in image recognition tasks.
