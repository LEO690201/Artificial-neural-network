AlexNet, introduced by Alex Krizhevsky et al. in 2012, is a groundbreaking convolutional neural network that marked significant milestones, including:

- **Revival of Deep Learning:**
  It triumphed in the ImageNet competition with a Top-5 error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% for traditional methods, igniting the deep learning revolution in computer vision.

- **Technological Innovations:**
  - **ReLU Activation:** First to employ ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
  - **Dropout Regularization:** Introduced to prevent overfitting, enhancing model generalization.
  - **GPU Acceleration:** Leveraged GPUs for parallel processing, overcoming computational constraints.
  - **Local Response Normalization (LRN):** Implemented to improve training by introducing a form of normalization across feature maps.

- **Structural Innovation:**
  Comprising 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers, it demonstrated the power of deeper architectures, influencing designs like VGG and ResNet.

- **Paradigm Shift:**
  It catalyzed a shift in computer vision from hand-crafted features to end-to-end learning, establishing the modern AI training paradigm based on large datasets, deep networks, and GPU-intensive computation.
