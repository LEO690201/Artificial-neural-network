LeNet, conceived by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998, represents an seminal convolutional neural network (CNN) with significance that includes:

- **Pioneering Architecture:** It was the first to integrate convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, establishing the blueprint for modern CNNs and accelerating the adoption of deep learning in computer vision.
  
- **Practical Application:** Its successful deployment in handwritten digit recognition, notably in check processing systems, demonstrated the practical efficacy of CNNs in real-world scenarios.
  
- **Foundational Techniques:** LeNet introduced key concepts such as local connections, weight sharing, and downsampling, which not only minimized the number of parameters but also set the design principles for subsequent influential models like AlexNet and ResNet.

  AlexNet, introduced by Alex Krizhevsky et al. in 2012, is a groundbreaking convolutional neural network that marked significant milestones, including:

- **Revival of Deep Learning:**
  It triumphed in the ImageNet competition with a Top-5 error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% for traditional methods, igniting the deep learning revolution in computer vision.

- **Technological Innovations:**
  - **ReLU Activation:** First to employ ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
  - **Dropout Regularization:** Introduced to prevent overfitting, enhancing model generalization.
  - **GPU Acceleration:** Leveraged GPUs for parallel processing, overcoming computational constraints.
  - **Local Response Normalization (LRN):** Implemented to improve training by introducing a form of normalization across feature maps.

- **Structural Innovation:**
  Comprising 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers, it demonstrated the power of deeper architectures, influencing designs like VGG and ResNet.

- **Paradigm Shift:**
  It catalyzed a shift in computer vision from hand-crafted features to end-to-end learning, establishing the modern AI training paradigm based on large datasets, deep networks, and GPU-intensive computation.
